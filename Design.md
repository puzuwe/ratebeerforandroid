# History #

RateBeer for Android is a new attempt to bring [RateBeer](http://www.ratebeer.com) to the Android phone. Once there was [RateBeer Mobile](https://github.com/jfm/RateBeer-Mobile) by Jesper F. MÃ¸rk, but this project was discontinued.

# Goals #

RateBeer for Android will focus on:
  * **Awareness** - Attracting new users to beer and RateBeer
  * **Personalization** - On-the-go support of finding and rating beers
  * **Localization** - Provide info relevant to a user's locality

In practice this means the app will offer:
  * Search and explore (top) beers without the need for a RateBeer.com account
  * On- and off-line rating of beers
  * Offer place and event suggestions based on a user's geographical location
Additionally:
  * Offer a phone and tablet interface (in one app)
  * Stable/robust experience
  * Point users to RateBeer.com and possibly the premium membership were appropriate
